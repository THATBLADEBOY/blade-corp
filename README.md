# BLADE-CORP MONOREPO

Blade-Corp is a monorepo built with [turborepo](https://turborepo.dev/). It is a collection of packages meant to be used together to build full stack applications quickly and efficiently.

## Project Structure

The monorepo is structured as follows:

- `packages/` - Contains all the packages that make up the monorepo.
- `apps/` - Contains all the applications that make up the monorepo.

## Packages

- `@bladecorp/ui` - A collection of React components that can be used to build UIs. Lots of the components at least started with [shadcn ui](ui.shadcn.com) as a base.
